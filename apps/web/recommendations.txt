Based on the analysis of your current project (Next.js 16, React 19, Tailwind CSS, Better Auth), here are the recommended frameworks and libraries to make your frontend "Industry Ready":

### 1. UI Component System
**Recommendation:** `shadcn/ui`
- **Why:** It's not a component library you install, but a set of re-usable components that you copy and paste into your apps. It works perfectly with Tailwind CSS and Next.js. It gives you full control over the code.
- **Dependencies:** `class-variance-authority`, `clsx`, `tailwind-merge`, `lucide-react`.

### 2. Server State Management & Data Fetching
**Recommendation:** `TanStack Query` (React Query)
- **Why:** Essential for managing asynchronous data (caching, deduping, background updates) in React applications. While Next.js has server components, React Query is still unbeatable for client-side interactions and complex state requirements.

### 3. Client State Management
**Recommendation:** `Zustand`
- **Why:** A small, fast, and scalable bearbones state-management solution using simplified flux principles. Much simpler and less boilerplate than Redux.

### 4. Form Handling & Validation
**Recommendation:** `React Hook Form` + `Zod`
- **Why:** `React Hook Form` reduces the amount of code you need to write while removing unnecessary re-renders. `Zod` (which you already use in the backend/packages) integrates perfectly for schema validation.

### 5. Icons
**Recommendation:** `Lucide React`
- **Why:** Beautiful, consistent, and lightweight icons. It's the standard icon set used by `shadcn/ui`.

### 6. Animations
**Recommendation:** `Framer Motion`
- **Why:** The production-ready motion library for React. It makes creating complex animations and gestures easy.

### 7. Date Handling
**Recommendation:** `date-fns`
- **Why:** Modern, modular, and immutable date utility library. It's tree-shakeable, meaning you only bundle what you use.

### 8. Toast Notifications
**Recommendation:** `Sonner` or `React Hot Toast`
- **Why:** `Sonner` is currently very popular for being opinionated, accessible, and beautiful out of the box.

### 9. Testing
**Recommendation:** `Vitest` + `React Testing Library` (Unit/Integration) & `Playwright` (E2E)
- **Why:** `Vitest` is a blazing fast unit test framework powered by Vite (compatible with Next.js). `Playwright` is the industry standard for reliable end-to-end testing.

### 10. Utility Libraries
- `clsx` & `tailwind-merge`: Essential for constructing dynamic class strings conditionally (standard with shadcn/ui).
- `nuqs`: Type-safe search params state management (great for URL-driven state).

### 11. Theming
**Recommendation:** `next-themes`
- **Why:**
    - **User Preference:** Essential for supporting Dark Mode, which is a standard expectation for modern "industry-ready" applications.
    - **System Consistency:** Automatically syncs with the user's operating system preferences.
    - **Avoids Flash of Unstyled Content (FOUC):** Handles theme switching on the server/client boundary correctly to prevent flickering.
    - **Tailwind Integration:** Works seamlessly with Tailwind's `dark:` modifier.
